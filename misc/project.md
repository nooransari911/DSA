**DBMS**

A database management system (DBMS) is a software application that is used to create and manage databases. A DBMS provides users with a way to store, organize, and retrieve data. It also allows users to share data with other users and to control who has access to the data.

There are many different types of DBMSs available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular DBMSs include:

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle
* Microsoft SQL Server
* IBM DB2

The choice of which DBMS to use depends on the specific needs of the organization. Some factors to consider include the size of the database, the type of data that will be stored, and the level of security that is required.

DBMSs are an essential tool for any organization that needs to store and manage data. They provide users with a way to organize their data, control who has access to the data, and share data with other users.



**JSON**

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based data format used for representing structured data. It is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application, as well as for storing data in a structured way. JSON is based on JavaScript object notation, and it uses a key-value pair format to represent data. Each key is a string, and each value can be a string, number, Boolean, array, or object. JSON is a popular choice for data interchange because it is easy to read and write, and it is supported by many programming languages.





**REACT JS**

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. React uses a component-based architecture, which allows developers to build complex UIs by combining smaller, reusable components.

Here are some of the features of React:

- **Virtual DOM:** React uses a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight representation of the real DOM. This allows React to efficiently update the UI without having to re-render the entire page.
- **Component-based architecture:** React uses a component-based architecture, which allows developers to build complex UIs by combining smaller, reusable components. This makes it easy to maintain and update your code.
- **Declarative programming:** React uses a declarative programming style, which means that you describe what you want the UI to look like, rather than how to achieve it. This makes it easier to write and understand React code.
- **High performance:** React is a very high-performance library. It is able to render complex UIs very quickly, even on mobile devices.
- **Large community:** React has a large and active community of developers. This means that there is a lot of support and resources available if you need help.

Overall, React is a very powerful and versatile library for building user interfaces. It is easy to learn and use, and it can be used to build a wide variety of applications.

**JSON-SERVER**

JSON Server is a simple and free open-source Node.js library and command-line tool that provides a quick and easy way to create a REST API for your JSON data. It's perfect for prototyping, mocking, and developing APIs without having to set up a full-fledged database.

JSON Server also supports a number of other features, such as:

- Pagination
- Sorting
- Filtering
- Searching


<html><h1><b>Design Part 1</b></h1></html>

This is designed in two parts. First part is DBMS system in C. Second part is displaying JSON file in browser using React JS.

C program takes input from user and stores user's inputs in JSON file.
